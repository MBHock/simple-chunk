To run the batch, just execute the following command:

  mvn clean install exec:java -Dexec.arguments="chunk-example"
  or
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.arguments="chunk-example"
     
	  where as "chunk-example" is the name of job XML, which lies in the class path.

To supply additional parameters in the batch execution, the command should be as follows:
mvn exec:java -Dexec.arguments="chunk-example jobParam1=x jobParam2=y jobParam3=z"

By using java only:
java -jar target/chunk-processing.jar chunk-example

Using command line argument:
java -jar target/chunk-processing.jar chunk-example threadCount=5 outputFilename=sample-chunkout.txt

To run in debug mode: (the debug mode must be configured as a remote debugger in your IDE)
java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000 -jar target/chunk-processing.jar chunk-example threadCount=5 outputFilename=sample-chunkout.txt
